## What is this?

This is a GUI Python program allows users to watch the network streams of different TV Channels. What it basically does is send a request to the servers of the TV Channel (get API Keys if needed and get url for stream)

## Is this ***legal***?

I don't know and I don't really care. If a TV Channel requests to delete their channel from my app, I'll happily do it!
